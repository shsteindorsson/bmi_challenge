Review and Reflect - Chapter 4
==============================

## First Test

 1. _Explain what `this` is in the context of an instance of a `Person` object._  

It assigns an instance variable to a new instance of `Person`.

 2. _Make sure you run through the whole code manually using the browser's console. What happens if you reload the page?_  

When the page is reloaded, created instances are cleared from cache. 


## The Calculator

 1. _What does the_ `setBMIMessage(obj);` _call do?_  
It calls the function `setBMIMessage()`, the argument (`obj`) was passed down from the original function call in `person.js`. 

 2. _Why do we have a separate function called_ `setBMIMessage` ?  
For modularity.
